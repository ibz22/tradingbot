# Trading UI Regulatory Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines UI/UX requirements mandated by various financial regulatory bodies. Compliance with these requirements is essential for legal operation and user protection.

## Major Regulatory Frameworks

### 1. MiFID II (EU - Markets in Financial Instruments Directive)

#### Required UI Elements
- [ ] **Risk Warnings**
  - Must be prominent and not dismissible
  - Specific wording: "CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage"
  - Display percentage of retail investors who lose money

- [ ] **Cost Disclosure**
  - All fees must be clearly displayed before order execution
  - Include spread, commission, overnight fees
  - Annual cost illustration required

- [ ] **Best Execution**
  - Display execution venue
  - Show price improvement opportunities
  - Provide execution quality reports

#### Implementation Example
```tsx
<RiskWarning>
  <Icon type="warning" />
  <Text>
    76% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs 
    with this provider. You should consider whether you can afford 
    to take the high risk of losing your money.
  </Text>
</RiskWarning>
```

### 2. SEC (USA - Securities and Exchange Commission)

#### Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule
- [ ] Display day trade counter
- [ ] Warning when approaching PDT limit
- [ ] Block trades if PDT restrictions apply
- [ ] Show minimum equity requirement ($25,000)

#### Implementation
```tsx
const PDTWarning = ({ dayTrades, accountEquity }) => {
  if (dayTrades >= 3 && accountEquity < 25000) {
    return (
      <Alert type="warning">
        You have made {dayTrades} day trades in the last 5 business days.
        One more day trade will flag you as a Pattern Day Trader,
        requiring $25,000 minimum equity.
      </Alert>
    );
  }
};
```

### 3. FCA (UK - Financial Conduct Authority)

  - Clear indication that account cannot go negative
  - Display maximum loss potential

- [ ] **Countdown Timer**
  - For binary options (if offered)
  - Must show exact expiry time

### 4. ASIC (Australia - Securities and Investments Commission)

## Common Requirements Across Jurisdictions

### 1. Order Execution Transparency
```tsx

  orderId: string;
  timestamp: DateTime; // Millisecond precision
  executionVenue: string;
  executionPrice: number;
  slippage?: number;
  totalCost: {
    principal: number;
    commission: number;
    spread: number;
    otherFees: number;
  };
}
```

### 2. Audit Trail Requirements
- [ ] Log all user actions with timestamps
- [ ] Record IP addresses and device information
- [ ] Maintain order modification history
- [ ] Store acceptance of terms and risk warnings

```typescript
class AuditLogger {
  logAction(action: UserAction) {
    const entry = {
      userId: action.userId,
      action: action.type,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      ip: action.ipAddress,
      userAgent: action.userAgent,
      details: action.details,
      sessionId: action.sessionId
    };
    
    // Store in compliant manner (immutable, encrypted)
    this.store.append(entry);
  }
}
```

### 3. Risk Warnings Display Rules

#### Placement Requirements
- Above the fold on landing page
- Before account opening
- On first login
- Before enabling leveraged trading
- Periodically (every 40 days)

#### Visual Requirements
```scss
.regulatory-warning {
  // Minimum requirements
  min-height: 100px;
  font-size: 14px; // Minimum
  background: #FEF2E8; // Must contrast
  border: 2px solid #F59E0B;
  padding: 16px;
  
  // Cannot be dismissible
  .close-button {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

### 4. Terms & Conditions Acceptance

#### Required Flow
1. Display full terms (not just link)
2. Require scroll to bottom
3. Checkbox confirmation
4. Record acceptance with timestamp
5. Version control for updates

```tsx
const TermsAcceptance = () => {
  const [hasScrolled, setHasScrolled] = useState(false);
  const [accepted, setAccepted] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ScrollableTerms 
        onReachEnd={() => setHasScrolled(true)}
      />
      
      <Checkbox
        disabled={!hasScrolled}
        checked={accepted}
        onChange={setAccepted}
        label="I have read and accept the terms"
      />
      
      <Button
        disabled={!accepted}
        onClick={recordAcceptance}
      >
        Continue
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
